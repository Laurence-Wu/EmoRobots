# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates EEG-based brain-computer interface capabilities with the LeRobot framework to enable direct neural control of robotic systems. The system will translate mental commands and facial expressions detected from EEG signals into robotic actions, creating a seamless brain-to-robot control interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to control a robot using my mental commands detected through EEG signals, so that I can operate robotic systems hands-free through brain activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a mental command is detected from EEG data THEN the system SHALL translate it into corresponding robot control commands
2. WHEN the mental command confidence score is above 80% THEN the system SHALL execute the robot action
3. IF the mental command confidence is below 80% THEN the system SHALL ignore the command and log the event
4. WHEN multiple mental commands are detected simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on confidence scores

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use facial expressions detected from EEG to control robot movements, so that I can have multiple input modalities for robot control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a facial expression is detected with high confidence THEN the system SHALL map it to predefined robot actions
2. WHEN both mental commands and facial expressions are detected THEN the system SHALL use a priority system to determine which command to execute
3. IF facial expression detection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to mental command control only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate seamlessly with LeRobot's control interface, so that various robot types can be controlled without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL establish connection with LeRobot's control API
2. WHEN sending robot commands THEN the system SHALL use LeRobot's standardized command format
3. IF the robot connection fails THEN the system SHALL retry connection up to 3 times before alerting the user
4. WHEN the robot is busy executing a command THEN the system SHALL queue new commands or reject them based on configuration
5. IF connection is refused during initialization THEN the system SHALL enter safe mode with EEG monitoring only and display clear error messages
6. IF connection is lost during operation THEN the system SHALL immediately stop sending commands and attempt reconnection
7. WHEN connection cannot be established after retries THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and provide troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a safety operator, I want emergency stop functionality triggered by specific EEG patterns, so that the robot can be immediately halted in dangerous situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a predefined emergency EEG pattern is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately send stop commands to all connected robots
2. WHEN an emergency stop is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp and EEG data
3. WHEN in emergency stop mode THEN the system SHALL require manual reset before accepting new commands
4. IF emergency patterns cannot be detected reliably THEN the system SHALL provide alternative manual emergency stop mechanisms
5. IF robot connection is refused during emergency stop THEN the system SHALL continue attempting to send stop commands and alert all operators
6. WHEN connection failures occur during critical operations THEN the system SHALL assume worst-case scenario and maintain emergency protocols

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time feedback on the robot's status and my EEG signal quality, so that I can understand system performance and adjust accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN EEG data is being processed THEN the system SHALL display signal quality metrics in real-time
2. WHEN robot commands are sent THEN the system SHALL show command execution status and robot response
3. WHEN the system detects poor EEG signal quality THEN it SHALL alert the user and suggest adjustments
4. WHEN robot actions are completed THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling for connection failures, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN robot connection is refused THEN the system SHALL display specific error codes and potential causes (network issues, robot offline, authentication failure, port conflicts)
2. WHEN connection timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network latency and robot unresponsiveness
3. IF LeRobot service is not running THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for starting the service
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL guide the user through credential verification
5. IF multiple connection attempts fail THEN the system SHALL suggest checking robot power, network connectivity, and firewall settings
6. WHEN connection is restored after failure THEN the system SHALL verify robot state before resuming operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to record and analyze EEG-to-robot control sessions, so that I can study the effectiveness of different control strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a control session starts THEN the system SHALL begin recording EEG data, detected commands, and robot responses
2. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL log timing, accuracy, and success rates
3. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL save all data in a structured format for analysis
4. IF storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL compress older session data automatically
5. WHEN connection failures occur during recording THEN the system SHALL continue logging EEG data and mark periods of robot disconnection
